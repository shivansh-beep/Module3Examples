Client-Side Programming language.
These programes execute on the client -machine without requirin any web server






JSP------------------Java Server Pages-----> Server-Side Programming  ----> Sun Microsystems
Why JSP was developed to be introduced?


1.Dynamic Web Pages.   
	a.Any changes done to the code,should not rely on server-restart
	b.Dynamic Presentation Layer


	c.Presentation Logic should be separeted from business logic


2. jsp do not require any entry within web.xml


What are Jsp
1.Jsp are also has compiled servlets:

2. All Jsp files should be saved with an extension    ".jsp"

(It means the jsp code will be converted internall by the jsp compiler into servlet code).

Ex:  demo.jsp                  
	
	demo.jsp-------------->jsp compiler----------------converts this jsp code into java code and saves it in a file called
	demo_jsp.java------------->next the javac  compiler----will compile the demo_jsp.java------>demo_jsp.class---->and this the
	class file which will be executed and loaded by the JSP Container-----> and th out put is anothing but the execution of the class.	

3. Lifecycle methods in jsp--->      _jspInit()   ,_jspService() _jspDestroy()
Features of jsp

1. jsp does not have any head and tail programing

2. in a jsp we can use html,javascript,xml, and java coding.

3.jsp files should be stord inside the root folder of ur webapplication.

4. Jsp is a complete short hand programming.


//  Combining Servlet and Jsp

We can develop the application using MVC Design Pattern

MVC1
MVC2
MVC3
MVC4



Model :  Business Logic      --(Java Beans)

View: Presentaion (jsp)

Controller:Application Logic                (servlet)
